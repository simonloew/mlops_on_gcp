# MLOps on GCP

This project shows how to implement MLOps best practices with GCP.

- `part1`: Implementing a VertexAI training pipeline to train a custom `scikit-learn` model. Related blog post: ["MLOps on GCP - Part 1: Deploy a Vertex AI Training Pipeline for scikit-learn models"](https://aiinpractice.com/gcp-mlops-vertex-ai-pipeline-scikit-learn/)
- `part2`: Adding the Vertex AI Feature Store to the pipeline and implement a feature pipeline with Apache Beam / Dataflow. Related blog post: ["MLOps on GCP - Part 2: Using the Vertex AI Feature Store with DataFlow and Apache Beam"](https://aiinpractice.com/gcp-mlops-vertex-ai-feature-store/)
